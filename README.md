Terraform code to create VPC, Subnet, IGW, Route Table, Security Group with apt ingress/egress rules, route associations and finally importing the key + EC2 instance creation. 

This is just a test code and cannot be considered as production ready!!  Use it for education purpose and build advance code by refering this test code.
